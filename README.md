This project simulates a secure communication challenge set in a fictional space-based storage system called REGULUS — a lunar data platform used to covertly share messages between Earth and Mars without alerting the prying eyes of Caltopia.

The objective of this project was to design and implement a secure file sharing system from scratch. The system enables users to create accounts, upload and share files, manage permissions, and revoke access — all while resisting a range of security threats such as data tampering, unauthorized access, and impersonation.

We were given access to a cryptographic library but no predefined architecture — pushing us to carefully design secure data structures and protocols. The implementation focused on ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and access control using concepts such as:

Public-key cryptography
Symmetric encryption
Digital signatures
Key management and revocation
Secure serialization and tamper detection

This project required balancing theoretical security principles with real-world system design and was one of the most rigorous exercises in applied cryptography, secure software engineering, and threat modeling.
